### Fixed Bugs

- On smaller devices:

- The Navigation Bar would lose its alignment, causing the menu items to shift to the left and appear under the site logo.

- The images displayed on both the Home page and Music page would only show the left side of the picture.

- The Youtube video would appear distorted and could be challenging to view.
  
- Without adjusting the footer, the link to Spotify would appear on a different line than the links to Facebook and Instagram. This would cause the alignment to look incorrect.
  
- Embedded Spotify links would be too close to each other making it hard to preview the songs.

- The contact form would lost its shape, as only the left side would be visible.
   
- On certain devices, such as the iPad Mini and iPad Air, there would to be a white space below the footer on the contact page.
